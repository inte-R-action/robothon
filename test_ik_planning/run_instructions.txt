Run UR robot command thing?

rosrun test_ik_planning test_ik_planning

To go to test point:
rostopic pub -1 RobotMove std_msgs/String find_test

To go home:
rostopic pub -1 RobotMove std_msgs/String home

To go to another object:
rostopic pub -1 RobotMove std_msgs/String find_<object name>

If you publish the same thing twice in a row it gets ignored! So publish dummy in between if needed, e.g.
rostopic pub -1 RobotMove std_msgs/String xxx
